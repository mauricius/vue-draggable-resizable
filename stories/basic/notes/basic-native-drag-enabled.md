# Component with native drag enabled

A basic component, with <b>`enable-native-drag`</b> prop set to `true`, in order to allow native browser's drag behavior. You can see the difference by dragging each component using the ball. Default value is `false`.

~~~js
<vue-draggable-resizable :enable-native-drag="true">
  <p>Native drag enabled. Try to drag the component from the ball.</p>
</vue-draggable-resizable>
